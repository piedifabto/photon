In the novel, Ian undergoes a significant character development as he interacts with Jacques and the other homeless people at the soup kitchen. He starts out as a privileged and indifferent teenager who only cares about his grades and his girlfriend. He is reluctant to volunteer at the soup kitchen and thinks that the homeless people are lazy and dirty. He also knows very little about Rwanda and the genocide that happened there.
 
However, as he listens to Jacques' stories and witnesses his nightmares, he begins to understand the complexity and severity of his situation. He realizes that Jacques is not just a homeless man, but a human being who has suffered unimaginable horrors and lost everything he cared about. He also learns about the history and culture of Rwanda, and the causes and effects of the genocide. He becomes more aware of the injustices and inequalities that exist in the world, and how they can lead to violence and suffering.
 
By the end of the novel, Ian has changed his attitude and behavior towards the homeless people and the Rwandan survivors. He treats them with respect and kindness, and tries to help them in any way he can. He also decides to do a school project on Rwanda and the genocide, and to raise money for a charity that supports the survivors. He even convinces his girlfriend and his classmates to join him in his efforts. He has become more compassionate and responsible, and more determined to make a positive impact in the world.
